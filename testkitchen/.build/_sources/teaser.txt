Site Builders use the Drupal interface to move most files to the server, but a variety of tasks are also performed solely (or more quickly) by directly accessing the server. There are many ways to accomplish this, and if you have a favorite sFTP client that you're comfortable configuring, you should feel free to use it!

For those without experience, we support FireFTP, a secure FTP client for Firefox available on OSX, Windows and Unix systems.
