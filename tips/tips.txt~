Embedding YouTube Videos
************************

When you're viewing the video on YouTube, e.g.::
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8FlmTlmdzc

#. Click the Share button

#. Click the Embed button

#. Copy the embed code.

   .. image:: sites/default/files/recipes/tips/youtube.png
      :width: 829
      
#. Edit the page, blog, or other content type where you want to embed the video.

#. Disable the rich-text editor.

#. Paste in the embed code.

#. To avoid issues with Chrome, you'll add some information in the embed code. For example, the embed code of the video above is::

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/P8FlmTlmdzc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
  Add ?wmode=Opaque to the end of the src url, so that the code looks like::
  
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/P8FlmTlmdzc?wmode=Opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


#. Once you've pasted the code, you can Enable the rich-text editor. It's normal not to see the embedded video until you save, but you can still highlight the shape and move it within the text by cutting and pasting.

Creating the Donor Quote pop-up
*******************************

Normally, you'll be editing the block with the Donor quote text and it will already contain the necessary HTML. Should that get deleted, you'll need to add it back in.

#. Disable rich text in order to directly enter HTML. If you don't, the HTML becomes visible and doesn't do what it's supposed to.

#. A link to the popup text should look like this. (You can change the visible text, Read More &gt, but not the information between angle brackets <>::

   <a class="fancybox" href="#fancybox">Read More &gt;</a>

#. The popup text goes between tags that look like::

  <div id="fancybox" style="width:100%; display: inline-block;">
     Text here.
  </div>

You can change the visible text, "Text here" but not the information between the angle brackets. It's okay for everything to be smooshed together.

You may need to press Enter above the popup text a time or two to ensure that it is not visible within the Donor Quote box.
