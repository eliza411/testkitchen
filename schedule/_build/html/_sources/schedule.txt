Configure the Date module
*************************

Date API and Date Popup
=======================
In order to allow use of the a popup calendar for scheduling, you'll need to enable the Date API and the Date Popup modules. Once you have, you'll immediately see an error message warning you that you must configure the date module.

.. container:: note_error

   The module and status pages will show warnings and display instructions for initially configuring Date module.

Configure Regional Settings
===========================
*Configuration > Regional and language: Regional settings*

**Locale**

#. Default country: United States
#. First day of the week: Sunday
#. [ ] Use ISO-8601 week numbers <- Leave unchecked

**Time Zones**

For this recipe, the calendar represents events happening in a single geographical location, so we won't be using timezone settings.

#. Default time zone: America/Los Angeles
#. [ ] Users may set their own timezones <- Uncheck this

Configure Date and Time
=======================

Initial Date Module Configuration
---------------------------------
*Configuration > Regional and language: Date and time*

#. Accept the default date formats or choose your own.
#. Click Save configuration. This provides the initial configuration for the date module and removes the warning on the modules page.


The latest content approach
***************************

Pros: Content is still visible if a user reaches it via a link from elsewhere or a search engine.

Cons: The article is still visible.

Create content to work with
===========================
*Configuration > Development: Generate Content*

#. [√] Check Article
#. [ ] Uncheck Basic Page
#. Generate 50 articles, going back in time for a year.
#. Generate

Create a page with newest articles
==================================
*Structure > Views > +Add a new view*

Intro screen
------------

#. View name: Articles
#. Show: Content of type Article
#. [√] Create a page
#. Path: articles
#. Display format: Unformatted list of Teasers without links without comments
#. Items to display: 25
#. [√] Use pager
#. Create a menu link > Menu: Main Menu
#. Link text: Articles
#. Include an RSS feed <-usually a good idea 
#. Continue & edit

Filter Criteria
---------------

#. add > Content: Post date
#. Operator: Is greater than or equal to
#. (*) An offset from the current time: -30 days
#. Add (all displays)

Advanced
--------

#. No results behavior: add > Global: Text area
#. No results
#. In the unlabeled text area, enter: No articles have been published in the last 30 days. 
#. Add (all displays)
#. Save

It's possible that your automatically-generated content isn't in the r

Create an archive
=================
*Structure > Views > +Add a new view*


Intro screen
------------

#. View name: Archives
#. Show: Content of type Article
#. [√] Create a page
#. Path: archives
#. Display format: Table of fields
#. Items to display: 25
#. [√] Use pager
#. Create a menu link > Menu: Main Menu
#. Link text: Archives
#. [ ] Include an RSS feed  
#. Continue & edit

Fields
------
This is the visible post date. We're accepting the default values.

#. add > Content: Post Date
#. [√] Create label: Posted on
#. [ ] Exclude from display
#. Date format: Long format
#. Add (all displays)


This is a hidden field that will allow us to group our results by month.

#. add > Content: Post Date
#. [ ] Create label: Month Year
#. [√] Exclude from display
#. Date format: Custom
#. Custom Date Format: F Y
#. Add (all displays)
 
Filter Criteria
--------------- 
#. add > Content: Post date
#. Operator: Is less than or equal to
#. (*) An offseet from the current time: -31 days  
#. Apply (all displays)

Advanced: No results behavior
-----------------------------
#. add > Global: Text area
#. Label: No results
#. In the unlabeled text area enter: No articles are older than 30 days.
#. Apply (all displays)

Format: Settings
----------------
#. Make all columns sortable
#. Grouping field: Content: Post date
#. Apply: All displays.
#. Save

Explicit Content Scheduling
***************************

Configure Scheduler Module
==========================

Let contributors use a popup calendar to schedule
--------------------------------------------------
*Configuration > Content Authoring > Scheduler module settings: Settings*

In my experience having the calendar to verify the day of the week makes content editors much happier.

#. Enable the Date Popup field. 
#. Save

Look at the Lightweight Cron
----------------------------
*Configuration > Content Authoring > Scheduler module settings: Lightweight Cron (tab)*

An automated process called a cron job runs at fixed intervals, and it is this process that triggers the scheduling or unscheduling of content. If you schedule an article to be published at 5:00 am, but the cron job only runs once a day at midnight, your article won't actually be published until midnight the next day.

Drupal 7 has a built-in sitewide cron job. Running it indexes your site for search, clears your cache, and is definintely overkill if you want fine-grained control over schedling. 


#. On the Lightweight Cron tab, read the text
#. Add this page to your shortcut bar by clicking the + to the right of the title. 

We'll use the Run Scheduler's cron now button during our testing.

Verify the server time
----------------------

There's nothing to change here. It's a place where you can verify that your server time is consistent with what you expect. Any changes to the server time must be made by a server administrator.


Optional: Configure your crontab
--------------------------------
Sure, why not? Using sFTP or shell.


Configure Articles for Publishing
=================================
*Structure > Content types > Article:  edit*

Publishing Options
------------------
The first step, ensuring that Articles are not published by default, is critical for publishing to work. Everything else can be set as you prefer.

#. [ ] Published <- It's critical that this is not checked
#. [√] Promote to home page <- Optional
#. [ ] Sticky at top of lists <- Optional
3. [ ] Create new revision <- Optional

Scheduler Settings
------------------
Locate the Scheduler settings at the bottom of the vertical tabs.

**Publishing Settings**

#. [ Enable scheduled publishing
#. [√] Enable Alter published time
#. [ ] Publishing date/time required <- Leave unchecked
#. [√] Create a new revision on publishing <- This provides an easily located record of the actual publication time

**Unpublishing Settings**

#. [√] Enable scheduled unpublishing
#. [ ] Unpublishing date/time required <- Leave unchecked
#. [√] Create a new revision on unpublishing
#. Save content type


Repeat for Basic pages, if desired. Use cases for unpublishing major navigational pages vary.


Schedule an article for publishing
----------------------------------
*Add content > Article*

#. Title: Publish in two minutes
#. Scheduling options: Schedule Publish on: for 2 minutes from now.  IMPORTANT: You have to enter the hour, minute AND second for the story to be scheduled.
#. Save

Run Lightweight Cron
--------------------
*Configuration > Content Authoring: Scheduler module settings > Lightweight Cron*

#. Click the button

Your article should stay unpublished. If you didn't add the Lightweight Cron page to your shortcut bar, it's at Configure > Content Authoring: Schedular Module settings > Lightweight cron (tab). 

#. When two minutes has passed, run lightweight cron again.
#. Verify that your article was published.


Schedule an article for publishing
----------------------------------
*Add content > Article*

#. Title: Unpublish in two minutes
#. Scheduling options: Schedule Unpublish on: for 2 minutes from now.  IMPORTANT: You have to enter the hour, minute AND second for the story to be scheduled.
#. Save


Run Lightweight Cron
--------------------
*Configuration > Content Authoring: Scheduler module settings > Lightweight Cron*
#. Your Article should stay published.
#. When two minutes has passed, run lightweight cron again.
#. Verify that your article was unpublished.


Create admininstrative views for authors
**************************************** 

Give your content editors the ability to track the flow of publishing can increase confidence in what you've built, reduce support, and ensure that if something does go wrong, people will notice!

Create the Next to be published block
=====================================
*Structure > Views > +Add a new view*

Intro Screen
------------

#. View name: Scheduling for Authors
#. Show: Content of type Article
#. [ ] Create a page
#. [√] Create a block
#. Title: Next to be published
#. Display format: Table of fields
#. Items per page: 5
#. [ ] Use pager
#. Continue & edit

Block details
-------------
#. Click Block
#. Display name: Next to be published
#. Apply (this display)

Advanced: Relationships
-----------------------
Because we want to work with information about content authors, we'll add this relationship. That will make the data available when we add fields and filter critera.

#. add > Content: Author
#. Apply (all displays) <-We're accepting the default configuration
#. Apply (all displays)

Fields
------

Edit the title
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. Click Content: Title (Title)
#. Apply (all displays)
#. [√] Create label
#. Label: Title
#. Apply (all displays)

Add the user name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. add > User: Name
#. Apply (all displays)  <- We're accepting the defaults here.
#. Apply (all displays)


Add the scheduled publishing date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. add > Scheduler: Publish on
#. Apply (all displays)  <- We're accepting the defaults here.

Add the current publication status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. add > Content: Published
#. Apply (all displays)
#. Label: Status (change from the default, Published)
#. Output format: Published/Not published <- I consider this an important kind of redundancy. Just because we build a view and we think it displays unpublished work doesn't mean our filter is correct. 
#. Apply (all displays)
   
Filter Criteria
---------------

#. Permissions View own unpublished content

You must explicitly grant one or more roles the right to view their own unpublished content; otherwise they won't be able to see anything that's on this block. We've given that role to our contributors. We'll base the permissions for this block on a user having that permission. Then, if you add more roles in the future, they'll automatically be allowed to see this block.

Place the block
===============
*Structure > Blocks > View: Scheduling for Authors: configure*

#. Region settings for Seven (administration theme)
#. Dashboard (main)
#. Save block

Schedule an article for publishing
==================================
*Content > +add Content > Article*

#. Title: Publish in one day
#. Scheduling options: Publish on: for tomorrow.  IMPORTANT: You have to enter the hour, minute AND second for the story to be scheduled.
#. Save.
#. Visit your dashboard again to verify the article appears.
