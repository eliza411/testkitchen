Does your organization require content review before the content gets published? We'll build a common editorial workflow that allows an author to create and edit his or her own work and submit it for editorial review. Author and editor can collaborate until it's ready to be passed along for final approval and publication.

      Eli has been assigned the Editor role so that in addition to being able to do anything a contributor can do, he will be able to edit the work of others and advance content for publication.

      Peggy has been assigned the Publisher role. This is the only role that will be able to make content live on the site. Publishers can do everything that editors and contributors can do.

Users and permissions
*********************
*People > Permissions*
   
We're working with three pre-created users, each of whom is assigned to one of the three pre-created roles that will be used in the workflow. Creating users and roles is routine, but permissions are one of the trickiest things to get right, so that's where we'll begin.



Node permissions
================

Before setting up the second layer of permissions provided by Workbench Moderation, we'll set the basic node permissions. These settings are based on the premise that no site content is ever deleted. During development, you might choose to allow the deletion of content.

============================== =========== ====== =========
Permission                     Contributor Editor Publisher

Revert content revisions       [ ]         [√]    [√]

Configure workbench moderation
******************************

Review configuration
====================
*Configuration > Workbench: Workbench Moderation*

.. image :: ites/default/files/recipes/moderation/workflow_simple.png
   :align: left

We will start by using the default states provided by Workbench Moderation and later add new ones. These states are adequate for the simple workflow pictured here. When we add a third role for review prior to publication, then we'll need to make adjustments.

Enable the workflow for content types
=====================================
*Structure > Content types > Article: edit*

.. container :: tip

   Although we don't cover this today, it is possible to moderate content on a per-content-type basis. This gets complex very quickly! See http://drupal.org/node/1206854#comment-5241230 for how to enable this.

#. Publishing options
#. [ ] Published (Uncheck this)
#. [√] Promoted to front page (Leave checked)
#. [ ] Sticky at top of lists (Leave unchecked)
#. [√] Create a new revision (Check this!)
#. [√] Enable moderation of revisions (Can only be checked once the item above is checked. Check this).
#. Default moderation state: Draft
#. Save content type
#. Repeat for the Basic page content type (although don't promote pages to the front page)

Set the Workbench Moderation permissions
========================================
*People > Permissions*

At the bottom of the Permissions page:

**Workbench**

=================================================== =========== ====== =========

Use "My Drafts" workbench tab                       [√]         [√]    [√]

Use "Needs Review" workbench tab                    [ ]         [√]    [√]      

Moderate all content from Draft to Needs Review *    [√]         [√]    [√]

Moderate all content from  Needs Review to Draft    [ ]         [√]    [√]

Moderate all content from Needs Review to Published [ ]         [√]    [√] 
=================================================== =========== ====== =========

\* It's oddly worded, but you must grant this permission to the Contributor. It really means "Moderate all content types to Needs review." It is limited in scope by your particular permissions for each content type. The Contributor role is only allowed to edit its own Articles and Basic Pages, so it Cathy Contributor won't be able to Moderate other peoples' work.

Check your permissions 
======================
*Configuration > Workbench: Workbench Moderation > Check permissions (tab)*

Workbench has a great feature to help ensure you've set up your transitions properly. Test both to be sure that each role can do what you want and also that no roles can do things they're not supposed to.



Watch Contributor > Editor Moderation in Action
***********************************************
*Home*

We're going to set up in two separate browsers, once for Cathy Contributor and one for Eli Editor so that we can watch as content progresses through the workflow.

Create an article as Cathy Contributor
======================================

.. container :: users

  .. figure :: sites/default/files/recipes/user_icons/contributor.png
  
     ..

     #. In the first browser, log in as admin and masquerade as Cathy Contributor. 
     #. Create a new article titled Contributor FAQ
     #. Note the message that the draft will be placed in moderation. 

View Eli Editor's Worbench
==========================
*My Workbench > Needs Review (tab)*

.. container :: users

  .. figure :: sites/default/files/recipes/user_icons/editor.png
  
     ..

     To save yourself the tedium of logging in and out or even masquerading back and forth, we recommend you install a second browser on your system, if you don't already have one.
     
     #. In the second browser, log in as admin and masquerade as Eli Editor. 
     #. View My Workbench > Needs Review (tab)
     #. You shouldn't see anything yet.

Move Cathy's work to Needs Review
=================================
*Workbench > My Drafts*

.. container :: users

  .. figure :: sites/default/files/recipes/user_icons/contributor.png
  
     ..

     Cathy Contributor can move her work from Draft to Needs Review in three places:

     * On the View draft tab of the node, just as soon as she's saved it
     * On the Moderate tab, where the entire revision history is available
     * From the My Drafts page

     Her work will be visible to no one but an administrator until she moves it to the Needs Review state. 

     #. Move the article created in 3.1, Contributor FAQ, into the Needs Review state.

.. cssclass :: page-break 
          
     2. Note that it disappears from Drafts and reappears on the My content page in My Edits. If Cathy bookmarks the page, she can still edit this while it's in the Needs review state, good for fixing that last typo. 
     
Publish Cathy's article
=======================
*My Workbench > Needs Review (tab)*

.. container :: users

  .. figure :: sites/default/files/recipes/user_icons/editor.png
  
     ..
     
     #. Reload Eli Editor's Needs Review tab.
     #. Locate Cathy's new article. 
     #. Publish it.
   
As Cathy, review the published work
===================================
*My Workbench*:

.. container :: users

  .. figure :: sites/default/files/recipes/user_icons/contributor.png
  
     ..
     
     #. Take a look at Cathy's main workbench page.
     #. Edit the Contributor FAQ
     #. Note that the officially-approved content stays published while this draft goes into moderation.
     
Experiment
==========

#. Try routing the article between Cathy and Eli in ways your organization might use workflow.
#. Try creating content as Eli. 
#. Switch back to the admin account when you're done.


.. container :: question

   What if Eli would like to return the article to Cathy because it needs work? He can send it back by setting it to Draft, but out of the box, it's difficult to add a message to the page. We'll fix that as best we can in the section :ref:`views`. There is a feature request to make it easier to add comments at http://drupal.org/node/1257650.

Expanding the Workflow
**********************

Add a new state
===============
*Configuration > Workbench: Workbench Moderation*

.. figure :: sites/default/files/recipes/moderation/workflow.png

   ..
    
   To add the publisher into the mix, we need a state for content that has been approved by the editor and needs a final review by the publisher.
     
   On the main screen, add a state:

     #. Name: Needs Final Review 
     #. Description: Ready for Publication
     #. Arrange them in order using the grabber  
 
         +  Draft
         +  Needs Review
         +  Needs Final Review
         +  Published
     4. Save

.. container :: note_error

   When you save, you'll see the following warning: 

.. cssclass :: warning 
   
   Depending on the changes you have made it may be necessary to reconfigure Views that leverage Workbench Moderation such as workbench_moderation. 
  
   In the section :ref:`views` will address the customizations necessary to take advantage of our new state.
   
Enable the transitions
======================
*Configuration > Workbench: Workbench Moderation: Transitions (tab)*

Next we define the transitions: 

Allow us to give editors permission to advance content to publishers.

#. Needs Review > Needs Final Review
#. Save

Allow us to give publishers the ability to send the content back to the editors.

#. Needs Final Review > Needs Review
#. Save

Allow us to give the publisher permission to publish.

#. Needs Final Review > Published
#. Save

.. cssclass :: page-break 

Remove an editor's ability to publish without final review.

#. Needs Review > Published <- Check delete
#. Save


Assign transition permissions
=============================
*People > Permissions*

Set permissions for the new states as follows. 


**Workbench Moderation**

============================================================ =========== ====== =========
Permission                                                   Contributor Editor Publisher
============================================================ =========== ====== =========
Moderate all content from Needs Review to Needs Final Review [ ]         [√]    [√] 
Moderate all content from Needs Final Review to Needs Review [ ]         [ ]    [√] 
Moderate all content from Needs Final Review to Published    [ ]         [ ]    [√] 
============================================================ =========== ====== =========

.. _views:

Adjust the views
****************
Since we added our own state, we'll need to create another tab that is visible to the Publisher.

Add an administration page for publishers
=========================================
*Structure > Views > workbench_moderation: edit*
