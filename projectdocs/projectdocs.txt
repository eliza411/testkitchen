Project Set Up Steps
********************
#. cp -r template projectname

#. vi projectname/conf.py

#. :%s/Template/Project Name/

#. :%s/template/projectname/

#. vi projectname/index.txt <- change the project name to the proper filename, e.g., exactly what you named the project folder.  This is required for the stripping script to work.

#. mv template.txt projectname.txt


About the setup
---------------
In order to make the output of Sphinx line up with Drupal, we have the following structure:


#. Actual image files are located in Sphinx/sites/default/files/recipes

#. This is sym_linked inside of Sphinx/_static which has the actual stylesheets we're using. sites -> ../sites

#. Sphinx/_static is a symlink inside each project: _static -> ../_static. This is created by copying the template.

#. strip_header.py is located in Sphinx and symlinked inside the projects: strip_header.py -> ../strip_header.py

#. the _build/html folder has a symlink to the sites folder, too, so that the images will actually load. This, too, is created by copying the template file.  sites -> ../../../sites

#. There's a substitution at the beginning of each file, \|sandbox-setup\| that is stored in the conf.py, which in turn pulls from the master symlink. To update this text for every project, edit the Sphinx/global.inc file. Presumably this will be used for other global substitutions in the future.


Working on the Project
======================

#. Document written steps.
