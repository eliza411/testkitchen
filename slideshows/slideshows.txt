|sandbox-setup|

Staple
======
#. http://drupal.org/project/ctools - Enable Chaos Tools (all others are not needed)
#. http://drupal.org/project/views - Enable Views and Views UI
#. http://drupal.org/project/libraries - Enable Libraries
#. http://drupal.org/project/views_slideshow - Enable Views Slideshow

Theme
=====
Because this recipe requires custom theming, we're using AdaptiveTheme (which makes the site mobile-friendly), Corolla (which makes it attractive), and Footheme (which provide our ready-to-customize subtheme). Customizing footheme means security updates and new features from our base themes can be easily applied.

Specialty
==========

The Views Slideshow module uses two external libraries.

Required for basic slideshow functionality:
  #. Visit http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/download.html
  #. Click the link to “Cycle Plugin”
  #. In your browser, choose File > Save Page as > jquery.cycle.all.js
  #. Place in sites/all/libraries/jquery.cycle (you'll have to create that folder) so that the final path looks like sites/all/libraries/jquery.cycle/jquery.cycle.all.js

Required for advanced features, which include setting the speed of the slideshow:
  #. Visit https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/downloads and download the appropriate format, .zip or .tar.gz, for your environment.
  #. Extract it
  #. Rename the directory (which begins with douglascrockford-) to json2 
  #. Place it in sites/all/libraries so that the final path looks like: sites/all/libraries/json2/json2.js

Build the form for creating galleries
*************************************

Add a new content type called Gallery
=====================================
*Structure > Content types > +Add new content type*

#. Name: Gallery
#. Description: Create an image gallery with slideshow controls.
#. Set the following values:

 ============================== ========================================
 Submission Form Settings       Title field label: Gallery name
 Publishing Options             [√] Published 
 Display Settings               [ ] Display author and date information 
 Comment Settings               Closed 
 Menu Settings                  [ ] Uncheck all menus
 ============================== ========================================

4. Save content type

Add an image field
==================
*Structure > Content types > Gallery > Manage fields*

Add new field
-------------

#. Label: Gallery image
#. Field name: gallery_image
#. Type of data to store: Image
#. Form element to edit the data: Image <- the default
#. Save

Field Settings
--------------

#. Leave as is: Public files selected, no default image
#. Save

Gallery Settings
----------------

There are a lot of settings here! Accept the defaults EXCEPT the following:

#. File directory: galleries
#. Minimum image resolution: 640 x 480 - We’re building our gallery around a common 640 x 480 resolution. By requiring images to be at least that large here, we can prevent jarring changes in size and eliminate white space between main images and thumbnails.
#. [√] Enable Title field

Gallery Image Field Settings
----------------------------

#. Number of values: Unlimited

#. Save settings.

Create proper paths
===================
*Configuration > Search and Metadata: URL aliases > Patterns*

Later on, we’ll be creating a landing page at /galleries, so we’re setting that as the path component now now.

#. Pattern for all Gallery paths: galleries/[node:title]

#. Save configuration
 
Create a test gallery
=====================
*Content > +Add content > Gallery*

.. figure:: sites/default/files/recipes/slideshows/slideshows-test-gallery.png
   :alt: Image of the Views Intro Screen
   
   ..

   When you're done, you should see the original sized images stacked down the page and protruding outside of the node region. Not to worry. We'll be hiding that and replacing it with our gallery slideshow soon.
   
   #. Gallery name: Test Gallery
   #. Body text: Optional
   #. Browse and upload at least 4 images, giving each one a title.
   #. Check the URL pattern is what you expect, something like: http://tests.l/galleries/test-gallery
   

Hide the default display of images
==================================
*Structure > Content types > Gallery > Manage display*

.. figure:: sites/default/files/recipes/slideshows/slideshows-hide-images.png
   :alt: Image of the Views Intro Screen
   
   ..

   #. Set the Default display setting format for Image to Hidden.
   #. Verify the Teaser display format is hidden. It should already be set that way.
   #. Go to Content and view the gallery you created in the last step.
   #. You should see nothing but body text you entered.

Create custom image sizes
*************************

Main gallery image
==================
*Configuration > Media > Image styles > +Add style*

We set a minimum resolution for uploading the image, but users can upload higher resolution if the wish. Using this style ensures uniform presentation within the gallery.

#. Image style name: gallery_main
#. In Effect, select the new effect Scale and crop from the drop down, then click Add
#. Width: 640
#. Height: 480
#. Click the Add effect button (Your changes are saved; the button on the next page is just for reordering the effects if there is more than one.)

Gallery thumbnails
==================
*Configuration > Media > Image styles > +Add style*

The thumbnail settings are chosen so the images stay proportional to a 640 x 480 main image and so seven thumbnails fit width-wise underneath it, with an allowance for padding.

#. Image style name: gallery_thumb
#. In Effect, choose Scale and crop, then click Add
#. Width: 80
#. Height: 60
#. Click the Add effect button 

Gallery index thumbnails
========================
*Configuration > Media > Image styles > +Add style*

Add a third style for the index of galleries on the site.

#. Click +Add style again
#. Image style name: gallery_index
#. In Effect, choose Scale and crop, then click Add
#. Width: 160
#. Height: 120
#. Click the Add effect button 

Create the galleries
********************

Views delivers extraordinary power to the non-programmer, and the price is a densely-packed interface. We describe the steps below, but there's a place where the screen cast is worth a thousand words!

Create the actual gallery display
=================================
*Structure > Views > +Add new view*

Intro page
----------

.. figure:: sites/default/files/recipes/slideshows/slideshows-gallery-intro.png
   :alt: Image of the Views Intro Screen
   
   ..
        
   #. View name: Gallery
   #. Show content of type Gallery sorted by Newest first
   #. [] Uncheck Page
   #. [√] Check Block
   #. Block title: Gallery
   #. Display format: Slideshow of fields
   #. Items per page: (Make this blank)
   #. Continue & Edit

.. figure:: sites/default/files/recipes/slideshows/slideshows-gallery.png
   :alt: An image of the Main Views Interface
  
   In main Views interface, we'll configure three areas:

   | A) Fields
   | B) Format
   | C) Advanced: Contextual filters

   We’ll set them up in this order because they depend upon each other, even though they’re visually in a different order.

A. Fields
---------

Add the main gallery image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. raw:: html

     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/XKXVWo0_uaI?fs=1" class="recipe-step colorbox-load" title="Watch this step">Watch</a> 

#. add: Content: Gallery image
#. [ ] Create a label <- Uncheck this
#. Image style: gallery_main.
#. Multiple Field Settings: [ ] Display all values in the same row <- Uncheck this
#. Apply (All displays)

Add the thumbnail gallery images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. raw:: html

     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/WNsXVJ8Z_FY" class="recipe-step" title="Watch this step">Watch</a> 

#. add > Content: Gallery image
#. [ ] Create a label <- Remove check
#. [√] Exclude from display <- Check this
#. Image style: gallery_thumb.
#. Multiple Field Settings: [ ] Display all values in the same row <- Uncheck this
#. Apply (All displays)

Add the Alt text
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. raw:: html

     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/HHqg_3v9x2A?fs=1" class="recipe-step" title="Watch this step">Watch</a> 

#. add > Content: Gallery image
#. [ ] Create a label <- Uncheck this
#. Leave other visible settings at their default
#. Multiple Field Settings: [ ] Display all values in the same row <- Uncheck this
#. Expand Rewrite Results
#. [√] Rewrite the output of this field <- Check this
#. In the text field, enter [field_gallery_image_2-alt] <- View the available patterns by expanding Replacement Patterns.)
#. Apply (all displays)

You now have three fields, all named the same thing but configured differently: the main image, the thumbnails, and the text.

Remove the title
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Content: Title <- Click the words
#. Scroll and click Remove

B. Format
---------

.. raw:: html

     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/hntqtWq3fH4?fs=1" class="recipe-step" title="Watch this step">Watch</a> 
 
#. Format: Settings
#. In the Top Widgets section, check Controls.
#. In the Bottom Widgets section, check Pager and choose the middle instance of Content: Gallery Image. This will provide the thumbnail images for the pager.
#. Apply (All displays)

C. Advanced: Contextual filter
------------------------------

.. raw:: html

     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/KmnDpv8vWKg" class="recipe-step" title="Watch this step">Watch</a> 

#. add > Content: Nid
#. (∙) Provide a default value
#  [√] Type: Content ID from URL
#. Apply (All displays)

Be sure to save the view!

Place and configure the block
=============================
*Structure > Blocks > Views: Galleries > Configure*

Configuring the block to display only on Gallery nodes prevents it from being called on a view, and listing it only on specific pages prevents it from appearing on the Edit tab.

#. Block title:  <none>
#. Footheme (default theme): Content <- Select from drop-down
#. Save block

**Visibility Settings**

================== ===========================================
Pages              (∙) Only the listed pages
                   galleries*
Content types      [√] Gallery (Check only this option)
Roles              (Leave as is)
Users              (Leave as is)
==============================================================

Create an index of all galleries
********************************
*Structure > Views > +Add new view*

You could create the gallery index page in the same view as the gallery block by adding a Page display, but the settings are different enough that they don’t gain a lot by sharing defaults, so we’ll create this as a separate view.

Add a new view
==============

.. raw:: html

     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/8RJ0l4juOZY?fs=1" class="recipe-step" title="Watch this step">Watch</a> 

Intro screen
------------

#. View name: Galleries
#. Show Content of type Gallery sorted by Newest first
#. [√] Create a page
#. Page title: Galleries
#. Display format: Grid of fields
#. Items to display: 24
#. [√] Create a menu link > Menu: Main menu
#. Link text: Galleries
#. Continue & edit

Fields
------

.. raw:: html

     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/4FynfGen1qI" class="recipe-step" title="Watch this step">Watch</a> 

#. add
#. For: All displays
#. [√] Content: Gallery image
#. [ ] Create a label 
#. Formatter: Image (no change)
#. Image style: gallery_index
#. Link image to: Content
#. Multiple Field Settings: Accept defaults EXCEPT change Display all value(s) so it reads Display 1 value(s)
#. Apply (all displays)
#. Save the view

A brief detour
==============
Some themes, like Bartik, have the Main Menu placed in the theme's code. Others, like Sky and our sub-theme of Sky, use the block system to place the main menu. 

Because we haven't placed the Main menu in a region, we can't see if our new view is appearing properly in the menu.

Place the Main Menu block
-------------------------
*Structure > Blocks > Main menu: configure*

Footheme uses the block system to place menus, and the main menu is not enabled yet. 

After you've located the Main menu block and clicked configure, under the Region Settings:

#. For Footheme (default theme), select Menu Bar.
#. Save block
#. Verify the menu and galleries link are visible by visiting the home page.

Arrange the menu links
----------------------
*Structure > Menus > Main Menu: edit links*

Now that you can see the main menu, you'll probably want to rearrange the links so that the Home link is left-most.

#. Use the grabber to drag Home to the top of the menu.

Auto-generate galleries
=======================
*Configuration > Development: Generate content*

#. [√] Gallery (Uncheck others)
#. Accept the rest of the defaults
#. Generate

When you're done, visit your gallery index page to see what it looks like when it's populated.

Style the Gallery
*****************

.. figure:: sites/default/files/recipes/slideshows/slideshows-before-theming.png
   :alt: Arrange the thumbnails.

   ..

   We're nearly there. The thumbnails present and you can click them to change the image, but they are taking up way too much screen real estate. We have text controls, but they kind of run together. There's text, but it's below our main image.
   
   To solve these issues, we will edit the our custom theme's css file to style the gallery.


Open footheme.css
=================

You can edit your stylesheet any way that is comfortable for you. If you need more support connecting than the username and password for your sandbox, see Connecting to your sandbox with sFTP at http://training.opensourcery.com/basics/sftp

Open sites/all/modules/footheme/css/footheme.css  If you're connecting to a sandbox, it will be located inside of www/drupal. You'll find comments at the top, but it's otherwise empty. Place the CSS for each step at the bottom of this file, save, and reload a gallery page to see the changes.

Arrange thumbnails beneath the main image
=========================================

.. figure:: sites/default/files/recipes/slideshows/slideshows-thumbnails-arranged.png
   :alt: The slideshow before theming.

   ..

   First, we'll float the thumbnails horizontally and ensure that they don't extend past the edge of the main photo. 

   ::

     /* Arrange the thumbnails beneath the main image */
     .views-content-field-gallery-image {
       float: left;
       padding-right: 13px;
     }
     
     .views-slideshow-cycle-main-frame-row-item {  
       padding: 5px 20px;
     }

     .views-slideshow-controls-bottom {
       padding: 0 0 0 20px;
       width: 680px;
     }


Format the controls
===================

.. figure:: sites/default/files/recipes/slideshows/slideshows-controls-formatted.png
   :alt: The slideshow before theming.
   
   ..

   If you mouse over the Pause link on the slideshow in your sandbox (not the image here!), you'll see the text hop around. That's because both words are given the same space but they're not the same size. We'll make room for Resume and add separators with the CSS below.

   ::

     /* Format the controls */ 
     .views-slideshow-controls-text {
       padding-left: 20px;
     }

     .views-slideshow-controls-text span {
       display:  block;
       float: left;
     } 

     .views_slideshow_controls_text_resume,
     .views_slideshow_controls_text_pause{
       text-align: center;
       width: 55px;
       border-left: 1px solid #ccc;
       border-right: 1px solid #ccc;
       padding: 0 5px;
       margin: 0 5px;
     }
    

Place alt text over the main image
==================================
*Structure > Views > Gallery: edit*


.. figure:: sites/default/files/recipes/slideshows/slideshows-text-overlay.png
   :alt: The text overlay.

   ..

   Notice that we use background, not background color, and that we're defining it twice. The first uses rgb as a fallback to provide a background color to browsers that don't support the alpha transparency in the next. We're also using background rather than background-color to ensure that a background is present in Internet Explorer. For a full discussion of this technique, see http://css-tricks.com/rgba-browser-support/

   #. Add the styling to footheme.css:

   ::

     /* Overlay the text on the main image */
     .views-field-field-gallery-image {
       position: relative;
     }

    .views-field-field-gallery-image-2 div.field-content {
      position: absolute;
      bottom: -10px;
      left: 0px;
      width: 610px;
      height: 45px;
      margin: 20px;
      padding: 15px;
      color: #FFF;
      background: rgb(10,10,10);
      background: rgba(10,10,10,.7);
    }
